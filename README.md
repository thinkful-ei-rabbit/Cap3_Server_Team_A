###### This README will systematically go over the entire app from the top level to the bottom layer, so I'll provide links to various sections for convenience.

# TODO - ADD DIRECTORY LINKS!

<!-- ? For Typescript only!
# Typescript:

## tsconfig.json:

Not much to it here - I opted for '`strict`' mode and '`ESNext`', though I need to compile to '`CommonJS`' since the tests are still in JS.

I wanted to utilize path aliases, but realized that when compiled the imports aren't updating, so for now I opted for avoiding referencing the `src/` folder in any local imports.

## jsonwebtoken.d.js:

I needed to re-declare the module here for this specific bit of code (line 187):

```js
type VerifiedObject = { sub: string };

export function verify(
  token: string,
  secretOrPublicKey: Secret,
  options?: VerifyOptions
): VerifiedObject;
```

Initially, the verify function had this type of return: `verify(): object | string` ...this didn't play nice when I needed the 'sub' key from it's return value:

```js
/* auth.js (line 66) */
const user = await CRUDService.getBySearch(req.app.get('db'), 'users', payload.sub);
```

Besides that, the module remains unchanged...

## express.d.js:

As a whole, I prefer writing namespaces for typing, and it so happens this is the preferred method (according to the docs, anyways) to customize the Express Request/Response interfaces.

I'd generally have a 'Types' namespace/file for app-specific types, but because all my custom types are only loaded into the Express namespace, I left them all under the same file.

The difference between the simlar naming conventions would be the something like `type NewUser` is applied to objects created from the `req.body`, while `type User` is created by pulling data from the database.

> _The `id` looks odd because it's only ever used in testing_

The only notable exception to the above ruls would be the custom Error type:

```js
type ErrorName = 'ValidationError' | 'UniqueViolationError';

type ExtError = {
  name: ErrorName;
  status: number;
  message: string;
  stack: string;
  errors: string;
};
```

...needed for my custom error handler:

```js
/* error-handlers.js */
const errorTypes = {
  ValidationError: 422,
  UniqueViolationError: 409
};

const errorMessages = {
  ValidationError: 'Invalid request',
  UniqueViolationError: 'Already exists.'
};
...
const errorHandler: ErrorRequestHandler = (error: Express.ExtError, _req, res, _next) =>
```

# db:

## migrations, seeds

Nothing much to say here, simple SQL code to seed the database

---

# src:

### server.js:

Bog-standard setup using Knex

### config.js:

I use this to configure all environment variables and export them from a single source. You can then access these via destructured imports:

```js
const { NODE_ENV } = require('./config');
```

### app.js:

Most of the setupp here is standard, with some particular use of conditionals and environment variables to configure middleware options. Note the absence of importing `express`, I'll get to that a little later...

### Barrels...

You may have already noticed that there are actually many **[ index.js ]** files peppered throughout the app. These are known as "barrel" exports, and have a few advantages when dealing with a complex file-directory. The index file in the [ routes ] folder has a short explanation, but I'll also put it here:

```js
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| BARREL EXPORT FILE
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| How-To barrel-export components:
| const thingsRouter = require('./things/thingsRouter')
|
| module.exports = {
|   thingsRouter
| }
|
| Why? Readability:
| const { thingsRouter, stuffRouter, userRouter } = require('./routes')
*/
const usersRouter = require('./users.router');

module.exports = {
  usersRouter,
};
```

You can see this in action in **[ app.js ]**:

```js
const {
  appRouter,
  bugRouter,
  commentRouter,
  editBugsRouter,
  sortBugsRouter,
  usersRouter,
} = require('./routes');
```

> _Note that the import doesn't point to the index file. Node perceives **[ index.js ]** files as points of entry and the default file to grab exports from, essentially making it an implicit file in import statements_

---

## constants:

Not strictly necessary, but this can help prevent typos, along with making changes to the database less tedious to update throughout the app.

---

## libs:

A simple Winston logger, though bacause Heroku doesn't support writing logs in this way, the transports aren't created during production.

---

## middlewares:

#### express-methods.js:

Though it may be inconsequential for a server of this scale, it should be known that every time you import a package from `node_modules` there's a memory cost at runtime, made worse by doing a destructured import. Express is costly to import (~750K unzipped), so I came up with this method here, resulting in importing Express only once in my entire server.

I can create both the `app` and `jsonBodyParser` (which is just middleware), and extract the `Router()` method itself (to be used as a sort of local "helper" function). Beacuase these are now local dependencies, I can import these wherever I want without an impact on runtime performance.

-Derek Nelis

#### body-validators.js:

These are used to extract and validate request body values on a per-route basis, serialize any user-inputs, then creates a completed object passing it on to the next middleware. There are a few helper-functions at the top to DRY up the code a bit.

#### auth.js, error-handlers.js:

There's nothing too special here, just basic Token authentication, password encryption, and error handling/formatting.

---

## routes:

- bugs: /api/bugs

```
  '/'  -   GET, POST (all bugs)
  '/:id' - GET (bug by id)
  '/user/:userName' - GET (bugs by user)
  '/severity/:severity' - GET (bugs by severity)
  '/app/:app' - GET (bugs by app)

```

- app: /api/app

```
  '/' - GET (graps all app names)
```

- users: /api/users

```
  '/' - GET (gets all users)
  '/token' - GET (grabs auth token)
  '/login' - POST (posts login)
  '/register' - POST (posts new user)
  '/dev' - PATCH (edits dev status of user)
```

- comments: /api/comments

```
  '/' - GET, POST (Get all comments or post one)
  '/:id' - GET (get comment by id)
```

- sort: /api/sort

```
  '/severity/:app' - GET (returns arrays of bugs based on severity sorted by status)
```

- edit bugs: /edit

```
  '/:bugId' - PATCH (edits a specific bug)
```

## database:

> _This isn't 100% representative of the current database implementation, but from a relationship view this is how the Server operates. Currently, the following tables are implemented: users, songs, sets, songs_sets_
